## Exercise I

```python
a)  a = 0
    while (a < n * n * n):
      a = a + n * n
``` 


```
b)  sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
      j = 1
      while j < n:
        j *= 2
        sum += 1
```


```
c)  def bunnyEars(bunnies):
      if bunnies == 0:
        return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
```
